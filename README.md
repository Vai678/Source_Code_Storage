Why I used Github?

1. Centralized and Accessible
GitHub is a cloud-based platform, which means code is accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.
I donâ€™t have to worry about losing files if the computer crashes, as everything is safely stored online.
2. Version Control
GitHub uses Git for version control, allowing me to track changes to the code over time.
It is very easy to revert to an earlier version of the file.
3. Organization with Folder Structure
GitHub allows me to organize code into folders and subfolders, which makes it very easy for the project.
4. Collaboration
GitHub is great for sharing projects to anyone.
5. Free and Reliable
GitHub offers free repositories with plenty of storage for source code.
