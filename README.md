Why I Used Github

GitHub is fantastic since it's in the cloud: you could easily access the code from wherever, and you didn't have to lose it just because your computer had crashed. GitHub uses Git as a versioning tool, allowing changes to be followed, differences to be identified, and versions rolled back if there are problems with what has happened recently. Besides this, making new branches to different features and merge later is relatively very easy on GitHub. It’s great for collaborating, with features like pull requests, issues, and code reviews that keep things organized. GitHub also supports CI/CD tools to automate testing and deployment. And with its large community and free repositories, it’s perfect for both personal projects and open-source contributions. Plus, it has a built-in search engine, so you can quickly find code or projects you’re looking for.
